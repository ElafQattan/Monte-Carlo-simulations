# Monte-Carlo-simulations
Monte Carlo simulations are a computational technique
that relies on generating a large number of random
samplesto approximate solutionsto various problems.
They are particularlyvaluable in situations where
traditional mathematical methods are either challenging
or infeasible to apply. [1]
And since running a Monte Carlo simulation involves
generating a large number of random samples and
performing calculations. Parallelizing this particular
process allowsfor distributing the workload among
multiple processing units, leading to faster computation
times, especiallyif the size of the simulation grows!
